# Distributed Web Crawler
### Background

This project is a distributed web crawler collecting users' non-sensitive information from a dating website [ZhenAi](http://www.zhenai.com/) and used for customerized search over different features (age, gender, marriage, occupation, income....). It is guaranteed that no sensitive information is ever reached and crawled.
